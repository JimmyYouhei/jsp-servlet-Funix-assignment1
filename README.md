# jsp-servlet-Funix-assignment1
 
## Introduction

this is the first assignment of Funix that require me get familiar with jsp and servlet including:
- printOdd page to print all odd number from 1 to 500
- a page to print fibonacci numbers that is < 10946
- A jsp Couse register page and another page to show the result

## Version
-	Java 12
-	Spring Tool Suite 4 (Version: 4.3.2.RELEASE)
-	Maven (version 3.6.1)
-	Tomcat (version 9.0.22) but not included. As a result please download yourself 
-	Bootstrap (version 4.3.1)
Other components are used according to “pom.xml” in the project

## How to install
please import as a maven project

## Project Detail:
-	Although bootstrap is used on every page, I knew that my design skill is lacking. In fact , I hate design (except software design). As a result, I can’t think of anything so just using like that to prove I know bootstrap 
-	The project follows the MVC architecture with “A1Servlet” as Controller and other JSP as View
-	The “index.jsp” will be the landing page
-	Other JSP file in “parts” folder is to be included inside other JSP file (as required by Funix)
-	JSTL is used inside every View JSP
-	All the main Java code will be inside the Controller: “A1Servlet”. I hope My code is easy to read 
-	“OddNumber” class is used to easily find odd numbers as required by Funix

##	Possible Issue 
-	Minimal testing, as a result very few exceptions are found and handled as Funix requirement is not strict

## Known Issue
-	Bad front-end design: I hate graphic design so please
